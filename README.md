# Know Your Rights

<h2 id="description"> Description </h2>

**Know Your Rights** is a website dedicated to explaining section III of the 1987 Philippine constitution, also known as the bill of rights. This website also aims to explain the implications and limitations of this part of the constitution.

Due to the sheer coverage of Article III of the 1987 constitution, the very first version of this website will only cover section XIV of the bill of rights. That is, we shall only cover the following:

1. A comprehensive introduction to section XIV of the bill of rights
2. The 10 primary implications of section XIV
3. Landmark cases involving section XIV
4. A mythbusters-type minigame on the applications of section XIV

Check out the explainations to all the code used in this website that you might not be familiar with in the `wiki` section. Also, feel free to point out any issues with the website in the `issues` section! I'm not so strict on Github conventions (because for the most part I don't even follow them HAHAHAHA), so don't be shy.
