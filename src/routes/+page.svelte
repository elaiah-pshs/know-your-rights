            Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, is a promising field emerging from
            computer science and programming. This field involves creating things that can
            think without any input. These objects are also called artificial intelligence.
            The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined by John McCarthy in one of
            his lectures way back in 1956. At that time, McCarthy could only dream of such
            a technology. Today, Mcarthy's dream of Artificial Intelligence is already a
            reality. We have already created artificial intelligence and integrated it into
            several aspects of our lives. Despite that, however, many people still do not
            understand what artificial intelligence is, how it works, and why we created it
            in the first place.
